    minimum number of shovels:

    Important:
    probability of an event = number of ways it can happen / total number of outcomes

    be careful with the overflow

    if n == 10

    he toggle the switch on the 1, 2, 5 and 10 -> the factors of 10

    intialy the bulb is off and if n == 10 we have four factors (even number)

    at factor 1 -> on
    at factor 2 -> off
    at factor 3 -> on
    at factor 4 -> off


    if n == 4

    he toggle the switch on the 1, 2 and 4 -> the factors of 4
    we have 3 factors (odd number)

    at factor 1 -> on
    at factor 2 -> off
    at factor 3 -> on

    so if the numbe of factors of n is even the last bulb is off
    otherwise is on

    so we need to know the factors of n
    the number of factors of any number is even but, if the number is sqrt so the factors of it is odd

    10
    1 * 10
    2 * 5

    4
    1 * 4
    2 * 2
