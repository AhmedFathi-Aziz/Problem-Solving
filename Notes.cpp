    Let's Go

    Day1:
    be careful with the spelling

    Time Complexity of Merge Sort:      Best:          Average:        Worst
                                     O(n log(n))      O(n log(n))     O(n log(n))

    Time Complexity of Bubble Sort:   Best:            Average        Worst
                                      O(n)              O(n^2)        O(n^2)

    Important:
    " when you pass an argument to a function you shoud pass it by reference "

    Ex: void convert(string &word) {}

    Important:
    test your code before you submit it
    you should handle all the test cases
    read the problem more than one and make sure you understand everything

    Be Calm
    " Not everything is sorting "

    Two Pointers is Important
    "11 Problems"

    Day2:

    if you need the shortest path between the alphabets you can move
    with the counterclockwise

    if the difference > 13 you should subtract the abs(answer) from 26
    
    EX:
    if we need the shortest path between 'a' and 'z' so we can move with 
    the counterclockwise from 'z' to 'a' the difference is 122 - 97 = 25 (clockwise)
    (26 - 25) = 1 move (counterclockwise)
